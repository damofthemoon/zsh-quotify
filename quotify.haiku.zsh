"How admirable,\n\
He who thinks not, “Life is fleeting,”\n\
When he sees the lightning!"

"The long night;\n\
The sound of the water\n\
Says what I think."

"The stars on the pond;\n\
Again the winter shower\n\
Ruffles the water."

"In the dark forest\n\
A berry drops:\n\
The sound of the water."

"Sleet falling;\n\
Fathomless, infinite\n\
Loneliness."

"Winter desolation;\n\
In the rain-water tub,\n\
Sparrows are walking."

"The evening haze;\n\
Thinking of past things,\n\
How far-off they are!"

"Leaves falling,\n\
Lie on one another;\n\
The rain beats on the rain."

"The wind brings\n\
Fallen leaves enough\n\
To make a fire."

"A trout leaps;\n\
Clouds are moving\n\
In the bed of the stream."

"A fallen flower\n\
Returning to the branch?\n\
It was a butterfly."

"The thief\n\
Left it behind\n\
The moon at the window."

"This dewdrop world\n\
It may be a dewdrop,\n\
And yet—and yet."
